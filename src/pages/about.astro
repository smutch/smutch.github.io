                    across the University of Melbourne and beyond, bringing
                    expertise and hands-on experience in data intensive
                    research, computation, and related infrastructure. My
                    expertise lies in scientific modelling, high-performance
                    computing (HPC) and a bit of bayesian statistics.

                    Until 2022, I was an astrophysics postdoc, focussing on
                    understanding the role that the first galaxies had in
                    driving the Epoch of Reionisation; an important phase change
                    in the Universe's early history. To investigate this I made
                    use of simulations and numerical models, in particular,
                    semi-analytic galaxy formation models (SAMs).
