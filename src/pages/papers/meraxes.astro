        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          We introduce MERAXES, a new, purpose-built semi-analytic galaxy
          formation model designed for studying galaxy growth during reionization.
          MERAXES is the first model of its type to include a temporally and
          spatially coupled treatment of reionization and is built upon a custom
          (100 Mpc)<sup>3</sup> N-body simulation with high temporal and mass resolution,
          allowing us to resolve the galaxy and star formation physics relevant to
          early galaxy formation. Our fiducial model with supernova feedback reproduces
          the observed optical depth to electron scattering and evolution of the galaxy
          stellar mass function between z=5 and 7, predicting that a broad range of
          halo masses contribute to reionization. Using a constant escape fraction
          and global recombination rate, our model is unable to simultaneously match
          the observed ionizing emissivity at z≲6. However, the use of an evolving
          escape fraction of 0.05 &#8212 0.1 at z∼6, increasing towards higher redshift,
          is able to satisfy these three constraints. We also demonstrate that photoionization
          suppression of low-mass galaxy formation during reionization has only a small
          effect on the ionization history of the intergalactic medium. This lack of
          'self-regulation' arises due to the already efficient quenching of star formation
          by supernova feedback. It is only in models with gas supply-limited star
          formation that reionization feedback is effective at regulating galaxy growth.
          We similarly find that reionization has only a small effect on the stellar
          mass function, with no observationally detectable imprint at M<sub
            >*</sub
          >>10<sup>7.5</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>. However, patchy reionization has
          significant effects on individual galaxy masses, with variations of
          factors of 2 &#8212 3 at z=5 that correlate with environment.
